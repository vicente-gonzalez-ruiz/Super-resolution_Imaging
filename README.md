# ESA Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS)

[ Super-resolution Imaging through High-frequency Subbands Prediction in the Wavelet Domain ](https://socis.esa.int/projects)

#### Scope
The main goal of this project is to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating super resolution images.
The proof of concept will be based on pattern recognition on images. 

#### Duration
The project completion will take place between June and September 2019.

### Stages
